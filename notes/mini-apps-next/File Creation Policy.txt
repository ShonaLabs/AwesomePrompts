# IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: FILE CREATION POLICY

## DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS

When working with the Next.js app router project structure for mini-apps:

1. **NEVER** create new files unless explicitly instructed with the exact filename
2. **ALWAYS** follow the provided project structure exactly as specified
3. **ONLY** modify existing files when directed to do so
4. **DO NOT** assume file creation permissions without clear instructions
5. **VERIFY** file paths before any creation or modification operations

## Remember

The structure is absolute and must be followed precisely. Do not deviate from the specified pattern or create additional files without clear authorization.
